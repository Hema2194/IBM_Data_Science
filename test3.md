# Ungraded Lab (Practice Assignment): Wine Quality Prediction

### Overview
This assignment requires you to construct a machine learning classifier using R to predict the type of wine. The datasets include red and white wines, with each wine having a "quality" score ranging from 0 to 10. There are 11 variables associated with each wine used to predict quality.

1.	Fixed acidity
2. 	Volatile acidity
3.  Citric acid
4.	Residual sugar
5.	Chlorides
6.	Free sulfur dioxide
7.	Total sulfur dioxide
8.	Density
9.	pH
10.	Sulfates
11.	Alcohol

### Environment Setup:
Ensure you have RStudio installed.
Load the necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

### Data Files

You will be using the below datasets for this lab. These files are already provided in the environment.

[white.csv](https://github.com/Hema2194/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/red.csv)

[red.csv](https://github.com/Hema2194/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/white.csv)

### Tasks
Your assignment submission will involve the below tasks:

#### Task 1: Report the mean and standard deviation of the white wine quality score.

#### Task 2: Plot a histogram of white wine pH.

#### Task 3: Plot a scatter plot of red and white wine alcohol.

#### Task 4: Construct a logistic regression machine learning classifier to predict wine color. Report which factors are significant in predicting wine color (p-value < 0.05).

### Offline Instructions:
1. Ensure you have RStudio installed.
2. Load the necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization (e.g., tidyverse, ggplot2, caret).
3. Place the white.csv and red.csv files in your working directory.
4. Use read_csv()("filename_csv") to load the datasets into your environment.

### Additional Notes:
- Make sure your data files (white.csv and red.csv) are available in the working directory.
- For the logistic regression model in Task 4, ensure that categorical variables are properly encoded.
- Follow best practices for data visualization and ensure your plots are clear and informative.
- If you're interested in turning this into a graded assignment, consider adding a custom grader that evaluates the accuracy of the logistic regression model and the correctness of the reported statistics and plots.
